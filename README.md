# TriviaGame

The main focus of this trivia game was to employ Timeout calls to make for a seamless quiz experience for the end user. The game also employs a heavy use of JQuery calls to consistently empty and rewrite HTML elements. The game also allows for the user to start over without having to refresh the page.
